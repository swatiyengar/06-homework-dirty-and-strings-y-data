 Cleaning and analyzing datasets with Pandas

## Assignment Description
Part 1: Beers. This dataset included information about craft beers, their breweries, and their metrics. The dataset required basic data cleaning (e.g. changing variable types, removing null values) and analysis using descriptive statistics and graphing
Part 2: Dogs. This dataset included information about dog licenses in the New York City. This dataset required more intensive cleaning and merging with with other population and location datasets to perform the requested analysis. 
## Lessons Learned
1. Plotting two histograms on top of each other
2. Creating grouped barcharts
3. Crosstab and Pivot Tables in Python
4. Levels and group_keys in groupby()
5. to_frame()
6. nthlargest()
7. Different types of merging 
## Challenges
- Plotting two histograms on top of each other: I accidentally added the x/y values as a list in hist() which created a very skinny plot
- I should have renamed the columns in the dogs dataset at the beginning - wasted a bit of time with typos in the original column names
- Creating grouped barcharts: referred to this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4538i9MQEc
